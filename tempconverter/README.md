### Intro

Title: TempConVert

TempConVert is a web app that allows the user to convert Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

This web app accepts input (K) and then posts a response based on the conversion to fahrenheit and celsius.  The goal of this project was to transform this terminal based app into a web app using React.
